# PI-MONITOR

Code for my Raspberry Pi baby monitor.

To use this you will need a Raspberry Pi with the following hardware and the associated python modules:

* Adafruit SSD1306 display
* Adafruit MCP9808 temperature sensor
* Raspberry Pi camera
* BrightPi camera light

Place the files in "/opt/pi-monitor".

You will also need the "picam" application. The picam binary should be placed (or symlinked) into the "/opt/pi-monitor" folder.

The contents of the "www" folder need to be served by a local web server.
